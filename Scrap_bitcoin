inspect ROI

Is the class "cmc--change-positive" is good class to use?
It is because in other currencies othr than bitcoin, there may be a negative change. so it is not a good class to use. 

Also, the question mark is also not a good class to use because it is linked
to different website, leading to potential errors of getting accurate numbers. 
I recommend you to study beautiful soup.
